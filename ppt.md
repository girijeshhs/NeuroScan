### **Slide: Introduction**

*   **The Challenge:** Early diagnosis of brain tumors is critical, but manual interpretation of MRI scans by radiologists is time-consuming, subjective, and faces challenges with increasing workloads.
*   **The Opportunity:** Deep Learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offers a powerful solution to automate and standardize this process, providing fast and objective analysis.
*   **Our Solution:** We have developed a full-stack web application that uses a state-of-the-art CNN (Xception) to classify brain tumors from MRI scans with high accuracy.
*   **Key Innovation:** Our system incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) through Grad-CAM, generating heatmaps that show *why* the model made a specific prediction. This builds trust and provides valuable insights for clinicians.

### **Slide: Problem Statement**

To design and develop an automated, accurate, and interpretable system for brain tumor classification from MRI scans that overcomes the limitations of manual diagnosis. The system must not only provide a reliable prediction but also offer a visual explanation of its decision-making process to be a trustworthy decision-support tool for medical professionals.

### **Slide: Objectives**

1.  **Develop a High-Accuracy Model:** To train and fine-tune a deep learning model capable of classifying brain MRI scans into four categories (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor) with over 95% accuracy.
2.  **Ensure Model Interpretability:** To integrate an Explainable AI (XAI) technique (Grad-CAM) to generate visual heatmaps that explain the model's predictions.
3.  **Create an Accessible Interface:** To build a user-friendly, web-based application (React frontend) where users can easily upload scans and view results.
4.  **Build a Robust Backend:** To develop a scalable backend service (Python/Flask) to handle image processing, model inference, and API requests efficiently.

---

### **Slide: Proposed Architecture**

Our system is designed using a robust, scalable, and decoupled **Client-Server Architecture**.

*   **Client (Frontend):** A dynamic Single-Page Application (SPA) built with **React**. It is responsible for the user experience, handling image uploads, and rendering the results. It communicates with the backend via asynchronous REST API calls.
*   **Server (Backend):** A lightweight and powerful API server built with **Python** and the **Flask** framework. It exposes endpoints to handle prediction requests and encapsulates all the complex machine learning logic.
*   **Communication:** The frontend and backend communicate over HTTP using a JSON-based REST API. The MRI image is sent from client to server as `multipart/form-data`, and the server returns a JSON object containing the prediction, confidence, and a Base64-encoded Grad-CAM image.

This architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns, allowing the user interface to be developed independently from the core AI engine.

### **Slide: Module Explanation**

*   **Frontend User Interface:**
    *   **Technology:** React, Axios, Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Provides an interactive component for file selection and upload.
        *   Manages application state (e.g., loading, error, result) using React Hooks.
        *   Sends the uploaded image to the backend API using an `axios` POST request.
        *   Receives the JSON response and dynamically renders the prediction, confidence score, and the Base64-decoded Grad-CAM heatmap.

*   **Backend API Server:**
    *   **Technology:** Python, Flask, Flask-CORS.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   Defines API endpoints (`/predict`, `/model-info`) to handle client requests.
        *   Parses the incoming `multipart/form-data` to extract the image file.
        *   Orchestrates the entire prediction pipeline: calling preprocessing, inference, and Grad-CAM functions in sequence.
        *   Constructs and sends a detailed JSON response to the client.

*   **Machine Learning Core:**
    *   **Technology:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   **Image Preprocessing:** Loads the image using Pillow, converts it to the required 3-channel format, resizes it to 299x299, and applies Xception-specific normalization.
        *   **Inference:** Loads the pre-trained `.keras` model and uses `model.predict()` to get the classification probabilities.
        *   **Grad-CAM Generation:** If a tumor is detected, it uses `tf.GradientTape` to compute gradients, generate the heatmap, and uses OpenCV to overlay it onto the original image, creating the final visualization.

### **Slide: Mathematical Model & Equations**

Our model's predictions and explanations are grounded in key mathematical concepts.

**1. Softmax Activation (For Classification)**
The final layer of our network uses the Softmax function to convert the model's raw output scores (logits) into a probability distribution across the 4 classes. The probability of class *j* is given by:
$$ P(y=j | \mathbf{x}) = \frac{e^{z_j}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{z_k}} $$
Where:
- $z_j$ is the output logit for class *j*.
- *K* is the total number of classes (4 in our case).

**2. Depthwise Separable Convolution (Core of Xception)**
This operation is more efficient than standard convolution. It works in two steps:
*   **Depthwise Convolution:** Applies a single spatial filter to each input channel independently.
*   **Pointwise Convolution:** A 1x1 convolution that projects the channels from the depthwise step onto a new channel space. This factorization drastically reduces computational cost and the number of parameters.

**3. Grad-CAM (For Explainability)**
Grad-CAM calculates the importance of each neuron in the final convolutional layer for a specific prediction.
*   First, we compute the weights ($\alpha_k^c$) for each feature map *k* for a class *c*, by global average pooling the gradients of the class score with respect to the feature map activations ($A^k$):
    $$ \alpha_k^c = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_i \sum_j \frac{\partial y^c}{\partial A_{ij}^k} $$
*   The heatmap is then a weighted combination of the feature maps, passed through a ReLU function to keep only the positive contributions:
    $$ L_{Grad-CAM}^c = \text{ReLU}\left(\sum_k \alpha_k^c A^k\right) $$

### **Slide: Implementation**

*   **Backend (`app.py`):**
    *   The Flask application initializes and loads the Keras model into memory once at startup to ensure low latency for prediction requests.
    *   The `/predict` route handles `POST` requests, extracts the file from the request object, and opens it using `Pillow`.
    *   A dedicated `preprocess_image` function resizes the image to (299, 299), ensures it has 3 channels, and applies the `xception.preprocess_input` normalization.
    *   `model.predict()` is called on the processed image array.
    *   If the prediction indicates a tumor, the `make_gradcam_heatmap` function is invoked. It uses `tf.GradientTape` to trace the model's execution and compute the gradients needed for the heatmap.
    *   The final heatmap is overlaid on the original image using OpenCV, converted to a Base64 string, and embedded in the final JSON response.

*   **Frontend (`App.jsx`):**
    *   The main component uses `useState` hooks to manage the selected file, loading status, and API results.
    *   When the user clicks "Analyze," an `async` function is triggered. It constructs a `FormData` object, appends the image file, and uses `axios` to send it to the `http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict` endpoint.
    *   The UI conditionally renders a loading spinner during the API call.
    *   Upon receiving a successful response, the result data is stored in the state, and the `ResultCard` component is rendered to display the prediction, confidence, and the Grad-CAM image (by using the Base64 string as the `src` for an `<img>` tag).

### **Slide: Results and Discussion**

**Quantitative Results:**
*   **Overall Accuracy:** The model achieved a robust **95.7%** accuracy on a held-out test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between different tumor types and healthy scans.
*   **Class-wise Performance:** The model exhibited high precision and recall across all categories. Notably, it achieved near-perfect accuracy for the "No Tumor" class, which is critical for minimizing false positives in a clinical setting. The confusion matrix revealed minor confusion between Glioma and Pituitary tumors, a plausible outcome given their potential anatomical proximity.
*   **Training Dynamics:** The training and validation accuracy/loss curves showed healthy learning behavior, with the validation loss flattening, indicating that the model generalized well without significant overfitting.

**Qualitative Results:**
*   **Grad-CAM Validation:** The generated heatmaps were qualitatively assessed and found to consistently localize the correct pathological regions in tumorous scans. For "No Tumor" cases, the heatmaps were diffuse and unfocused, which is the expected and correct behavior. This confirms that the model is learning clinically relevant features rather than relying on spurious artifacts.

**Comparison with Existing Work:**

| System | Method | Accuracy | Interpretability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Traditional (Zacharaki et al.) | SVM + Manual Features | ~85-90% | Low (Features are hand-picked) |
| Basic CNNs | Standard CNN | ~90-94% | No (Black Box) |
| **Our System** | **Xception + Grad-CAM** | **>95%** | **High (Visual Heatmaps)** |

Our system's primary advantage lies not just in its high accuracy but in its tight integration of an explainability mechanism within a practical, user-friendly application, making it a superior decision-support tool.
